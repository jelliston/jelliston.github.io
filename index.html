	<p>
		I am a school teacher, project manager and developer and 
        have spent most of my working life in education-focused endeavors.

	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy building things that are related to education 
        generally, or that help with my teaching, or that inspire 
		me or my kids.
	</p>
	<p>
		Primarily I am working on personal projects, but I have occasionally been hired to help design and build websites.  
		You can find me on
		<a href="https://github.com/jelliston">GitHub</a> here (I absolutely suck at my own social media).
