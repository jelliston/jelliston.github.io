		I am a school teacher, project manager and developer and 
        have worked most of my life in education.

		Training-wise I most recently received an MBA from the 
		<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/"><abbr title="University of Sheffield">University of Sheffield</abbr></a>
        in the UK. Before that I received my BSc in 
        Managerial Economics from <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/"><abbr title="UC Davis">UC Davis</abbr></a>
		in the US.

		I enjoy building things that are related to education, 
        generally, or that help with my teaching, or that inspire 
        me or my kids.
